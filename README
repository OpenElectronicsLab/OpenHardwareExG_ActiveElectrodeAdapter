# OpenHardwareExG_ActiveElectrodeAdapter

This is an adapter board to simplify connecting one or more
OpenHardwareExG_ActiveElectrode s to devices that used 0.1 inch pitch
connectors such as the OpenHardwareExG_Shield or a breadboard.

This project is in early development and is not yet ready for use.
